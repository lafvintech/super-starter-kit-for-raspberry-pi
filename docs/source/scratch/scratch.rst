Scratch(Pi 4 & earlier)
====================================

    Scratch is a block-based visual programming language and online platform primarily designed to introduce coding concepts to children aged 8-16. It offers a user-friendly interface where projects can be created using blocks, making it accessible and engaging for young learners. Developed by the MIT Media Lab, Scratch has been translated into over 70 languages and enjoys widespread usage globally.



.. note::

    Here you will learn to use Scratch 3 in Raspberry Pi and access Raspberry Pi GPIO with Scratch 3, which is not possible with online Scratch.

    If you are a user who has just used Scratch 3, we recommend that you try the projects in order so that you can quickly get started with Scratch 3.
	
    Before attempting the projects, make sure you have downloaded the necessary materials and code files.
    Open a Terminal and enter the following command to download them from github. `Download the Code <../preparation/download_the_Code.html>`_
