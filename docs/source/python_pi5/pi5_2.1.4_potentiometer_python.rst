2.1.4 Potentiometer
===================

Introduction
------------

The ADC function can be used to convert analog signals to digital
signals, and in this experiment, ADC0834 is used to get the function
involving ADC. Here, we implement this process by using potentiometer.
Potentiometer changes the physical quantity -- voltage, which is
converted by the ADC function.

Components
------------------------------

In this project, we need the following components.

**ADS7830**

The ADS7830 is a single-supply, low-power, 8-bit data acquisition device that features a serial I2C interface and an 8-channel multiplexer. The following table is the pin definition diagram of ADS7830.

**ADC**

An ADC is an electronic integrated circuit used to convert analog signals such as voltages to digital or
binary form consisting of 1s and 0s. The range of our ADC module is 8 bits, that means the resolution is
2^8=256, so that its range (at 3.3V) will be divided equally to 256 parts.
Any analog value can be mapped to one digital value using the resolution of the converter. So the more bits
the ADC has, the denser the partition of analog will be and the greater the precision of the resulting conversion.

Subsection 1: the analog in range of 0V-3.3/256 V corresponds to digital 0;

Subsection 2: the analog in range of 3.3 /256 V-2*3.3 /256V corresponds to digital 1;

â€¦

The resultant analog signal will be divided accordingly.

Experimental Procedures
-----------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

.. note::
    Please place the chip by referring to the corresponding position
    depicted in the picture. Note that the grooves on the chip should be on
    the left when it is placed.

**Step 2:** Open the code file

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/super-starter-kit-for-raspberry-pi/python-pi5/python-pi5

**Step 3:** Run.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 2.1.4_Potentiometer_zero.py

After the code runs, rotate the knob on the potentiometer, the intensity
of LED will change accordingly.

**Code**

.. note::

    You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to  source code path like ``super-starter-kit-for-raspberry-pi/python-pi5/python-pi5``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python3

   import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
   import time
   from ADCDevice import *

   # Initialize a PWM LED on GPIO pin 22
   ledPin = 11
   adc = ADCDevice() # Define an ADCDevice class object

   def setup():

            adc = ADS7830()

            "Please use command 'i2cdetect -y 1' to check the I2C address! \n"

            time.sleep(0.03)

   def destroy():
       p.stop()  # stop PWM  
       GPIO.cleanup()
       adc.close()
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':   # Program entrance
        print ('Program is starting ... ')
        try:

**Code Explanation**

#. 
    In this code, a custom Python module "ADCDevice" is used. It contains the method of utilizing the ADC 
    Module in this project, through which the ADC Module can easily and quickly be used. In the code, you need 
    to first create an ADCDevice object adc.
    
   .. code-block:: python

      adc = ADCDevice() # Define an ADCDevice class object

#. Then in setup(), use detecticIC(addr), the member function of ADCDevice, to detect the I2C module in the circuit. Different modules have different I2C addresses. Therefore, according to the address, we can determine which ADC Module is in the circuit. When the correct module is detected, a device specific class object is created and assigned to adc. The default address of  ADS7830 is 0x48.

   .. code-block:: python

     def setup():
        global adc
        if(adc.detectI2C(0x48)): # Detect the ads7830
            adc = ADS7830()
        else:
            print("No correct I2C address found, \n"
            "Please use command 'i2cdetect -y 1' to check the I2C address! \n"
            "Program Exit. \n");
            exit(-1)
        global p
        GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
        GPIO.setup(ledPin,GPIO.OUT)
        p = GPIO.PWM(ledPin,1000)
        p.start(0)

#. When you have a class object of a specific device, you can get the ADC value of the specified channel by calling the member function of this class, analogRead(chn). In loop(), get the ADC value of potentiometer.

   .. code-block:: python

       value = adc.analogRead(0) # read the ADC value of channel 0

#. Then according to the formula, the voltage value is calculated and displayed on the terminal monitor.

   .. code-block:: python

        voltage = value / 255.0 * 3.3 # calculate the voltage value
        print ('ADC Value : %d, Voltage : %.2f'%(value,voltage))
        time.sleep(0.1)
