# Download the Code

Before you download the code, please note that the example code is **ONLY** test on Raspberry Pi OS. We provide two methods for download:

**Method 1: Use git clone (Recommended)**

Log into Raspberry Pi and then change directory to `/home/pi`.

```
cd ~/
```

<div class="warning" style="background-color: #E7F2FA; color=#6AB0DE; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #333; border-radius: 5px;">
    NOTE: cd to change to the intended directory from the current path. Informally, here is to go to the path `~/`.
